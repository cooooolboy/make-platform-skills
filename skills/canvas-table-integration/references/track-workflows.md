## Choose a primary path first

Choose one primary path before coding.

### Track A / `basic local table`

Use when the page already has all rows in client memory and is still using `@qfei-design/canvas-table`.

Start from:

- `recipes.json` -> `basic-local-table`
- `examples/react/basic-canvas-table.tsx`

### Track A / `virtual remote table`

Use only when the user explicitly asks for pagination, virtual loading, or paginated backend integration, and still use `@qfei-design/canvas-table`. Do not choose this path just because the page contains a table.

Start from:

- `recipes.json` -> `virtual-remote-table`
- `examples/react/virtual-canvas-table.tsx`
- `references/virtual-table-patterns.md`

### Track A / `meta -> columns`

Use when column configuration comes from JSON/meta instead of handwritten `IColumn[]`.

Treat this as a supporting path, not the primary first-pass path, unless the page is clearly meta-driven.
If the JSON/meta is Make schema field metadata, use Track C as the primary path and treat column conversion as one step inside the Make field-display workflow.

### Track B / `host cell-edit architecture`

Use when the page must edit business fields in-place or through editor overlays.

Before changing code, identify:

- framework: React or Vue
- existing component library
- existing business field editors
- existing upload / date / select / people / department widgets
- field metadata shape: editability, required, field type, precision, format, multi/single mode, attachment value structure
- stable backend identity: the host backend's system id or equivalent row key for persisted rows and attachment upload
- whether the host Drawer form already maps Make field types; reuse that mapping so table cell editors and Drawer forms submit the same value shapes

Do not invent a new editor system if the project already has one.

## Track B pragmatic host-edit guidance

Use these defaults for first-pass editable-list work. Adapt them to the host project's real component system, save model, and backend contract.

1. Declare `editType: "custom"` on target editable columns; do not assume `customEdit` alone is enough.
2. Start with the smallest working editor bridge before abstracting the editor container.
3. Prefer page-level draft state over table-internal edit state. The page owns draft values, dirty rows, save/discard actions, and unsaved-change guards.
4. Use `edit:end` as the stable post-commit boundary. Do not hide all data mutation inside the table wrapper.
5. Prefer canvas-table native row coloring such as `setRowColors(rowKeys, color)` for dirty-row highlighting.
6. Define unsaved-change behavior for context changes such as tab switch, query reset, open detail, or create new.
7. Keep text, number, select, date, and attachment metadata as reusable editor patterns, not fixed component choices.
8. Use `editApplyMode: "controlled"` when a business save or draft layer owns writes; after save accepts a commit, backfill with `setCellData(...)` or `setRowData(...)`.
9. For popup editors, return `relatedElements()`, use `overlayOptions` when overflow is needed, and prefer object `autoClose`.
10. Keep table initialization stable during draft updates; do not recreate the table just because merged rows or callbacks changed.
11. Restore focus to the current canvas only inside the canvas edit lifecycle; never steal focus from host modal, drawer, dialog, popover, or form interactions.
12. Guarantee usable canvas height before initialization; padding-only containers are not enough.
13. Date editors must resolve typed input before OK commits.
14. Use stable backend identity for persisted editable rows; keep mutable business codes out of technical row keys.
15. Attachment editors are host popups with data-source upload boundaries; real upload/delete/download proxy logic belongs to the host data-source or Service API adapter.

## Track A workflow

1. Check whether the package is installed.
2. If missing, install it with the lockfile-based package-manager rule in `SKILL.md`.
3. Read the package docs in the required order.
4. Choose the primary path.
5. Open the corresponding recipe and minimal example.
6. Adapt that example to the current project with the smallest reasonable diff.
7. Preserve the local framework and state-management patterns.
8. Add only the capabilities the user explicitly needs now. Pagination is not a default table capability.
9. Avoid unrelated refactors.
10. Run at least one concrete verification step if the environment allows it.

## Track B workflow

1. Check whether the package is installed.
2. Read package editing docs and the edit-related source entry points.
3. Identify the host framework, component library, and existing field-editor components.
4. Identify the field metadata that drives editability and field type.
5. Identify the stable row identity used by backend reads, saves, dirty state, and detail routes.
6. Read the host Make schema and Drawer form field mapping before coding editors.
7. Classify supported field types into text, number, date, option, identity, attachment, and read-only groups before coding editors.
8. For date, user, department, select, file, and lookup fields, choose a type-appropriate editor, read-only display, or explicit documented fallback before implementation.
9. Design or reuse a host edit controller layer before writing field-specific code.
10. Design or reuse a single editor-container abstraction before writing individual field editors.
11. Implement or reuse field editors through a common editor interface.
12. Distinguish submit-style editors from realtime-style editors.
13. For attachment fields, identify whether upload requires a saved record id and where the data-source / Service API adapter upload/delete/download boundary lives.
14. Validate positioning, scroll behavior, click-outside close, and rollback behavior.
15. Verify at least one real editable field flow in the target project.

## Track C workflow

1. Check whether the package is installed and read the package docs in the required order.
2. For new Make App projects, apply the ExpensePoc-derived table display baseline unless the user explicitly asks for another visual style.
3. Identify the Make field schema shape and the actual backend value formats.
4. Normalize backend schema variants, such as `entity.properties.fields` or `entity.fields`, before the table layer consumes them.
5. Gate table initialization until normalized schema fields are available; missing schema is a loading/error state, not a reason to infer columns from row data.
6. Build or reuse a pure display adapter by field type before writing canvas shapes.
7. Derive column configs from normalized schema fields; avoid hand-maintained static columns for dynamic schemas.
8. Route display groups to focused renderers: text/clickable URL, tag list, user avatar/name list, attachment list, lookup reference text, and generic text fallback.
9. Keep option/candidate loading outside cell renderers; pass normalized rows and field schemas into the table.
10. Enable default row affordances: `showSN` sequence numbers and hover-revealed detail entry through `bodyRowHeadSuffixOptions`, unless explicitly disabled.
11. Add focused tests for schema normalization, value normalization, renderer overflow/empty states, schema-gated initialization, and the row-head defaults.
12. Verify at least one table path with representative backend values.

## Capability checklists

Track A common capabilities:

- base columns: `key`, `title`, `width`, `align`, `headerAlign`, `fixed`, `showEllipsis`
- local data updates via `setData(rows)`
- virtual paged updates via `setData(rows, page)`
- `updateProps(...)` for column / size / config updates
- default sequence numbers via `showSN`
- default detail entry via `bodyRowHeadSuffixOptions`
- optional row selection via `selectable` + `selection:change`
- row drag via `rowSortable`
- column drag using the built-in header interaction
- summary rows via `showSummary`, `summaryData`, `summaryRenderer`
- empty states via `emptyStateOptions`
- custom cell rendering via `render`
- lightweight clickable shapes via `TextShape` and shape-level click behavior

Track B common capabilities:

- editable column declaration via `editType`
- `customEdit` contract handling
- editor-container pattern with a stable editor interface
- edit controller for old/new value, save, reset, rollback, and outside-click handling
- submit-style and realtime-style field editors
- field-editor mapping by business field type
- Make-style field coverage: `ID`, `Text`, `TextArea`, `URL`, `Number`, `Currency`, `Percent`, `Date`, `DateTime`, `DateRange`, `SingleSelect`, `MultiSelect`, `SingleUser`, `MultiUser`, `SingleDepartment`, `MultiDepartment`, `File`, `Lookup`
- editor overlay positioning and scroll-follow behavior
- `commit(...)` / `cancel(...)` / `updateValue(...)` usage, with `close(commit)` and `changeValue(...)` treated as legacy compatibility only
- `edit:end` as the post-commit event surface
- attachment field integration using host upload/file components or drag/drop DOM editors plus canvas-table render support
- backend system identity handling for row keys, dirty keys, detail routes, and attachment preconditions

Track C common capabilities:

- `@qfei-design/canvas-table` as the only product table implementation
- raw Make schema variants normalized before table code sees them
- normalized Make schema fields converted to `IColumn[]` at runtime
- initialization waits for schema fields instead of inferring columns from row keys
- 18 Make field types mapped to display group and kind
- pure field-display adapter before canvas rendering
- text/link renderer with ellipsis, tooltip, empty `-`, and safe click handling
- tag renderer for select and department values, including `+N` overflow
- user renderer with avatar image, deterministic fallback avatar, name text, and `+N` overflow
- attachment renderer with image thumbnails, file-extension blocks, safe open behavior, and `+N` overflow
- lookup renderer with clickable valid references, muted deleted references, strikethrough, and fallback label extraction
- row-head defaults: `showSN` and `bodyRowHeadSuffixOptions`
- object/entity/schema switch resets table scroll and transient state; same-object data refresh may preserve scroll
- user/department edit candidates come from host candidate sources; generated Make App defaults are `/api/users` and `/api/departments`, normalized to `userId/userName` and `departmentId/departmentName`

## What to avoid

Track A:

- building a grouped-table solution when a flat table is enough
- designing a full edit flow when the page only needs display + click actions
- overusing custom shapes when plain columns are sufficient
- relying on internal events or internal classes
- stuffing raw meta directly into runtime props
- skipping resize / cleanup handling

Before finishing Track A or C, read `references/common-pitfalls.md`.

Track B:

- forcing a brand-new component library into the project
- putting all editor logic directly into `customEdit`
- failing to separate display value and submit value
- treating all field types as the same commit model
- not updating editor position during scroll
- closing complex editors without save / rollback logic
- writing attachment support as render-only without an editor contract
- putting real attachment upload calls into canvas-table or a generic table wrapper
- defaulting date, user, department, select, file, or lookup fields to bare text inputs without explaining the missing schema/API reason
- using a business display code as the row key when persisted edits need a backend system id
- copying a Vue pattern into React without converting it into hook/ref-based host patterns

Before finishing Track B, read `references/edit-common-pitfalls.md`.

Track C:

- branching by field name for generic display behavior; branch by field type or explicit business role
- rendering raw objects or JSON wrapper strings when a useful label can be extracted
- fetching options, users, departments, or files inside a cell renderer
- creating generic text columns from row object keys when schema fields are unavailable
- flattening select, user, department, file, or lookup values into plain text when the schema type supports richer default rendering
- mixing display formatting with submit/edit payload conversion
- making unknown future field types crash the table; use a safe text fallback
- forcing exact folder/file names when the host project already has clear ownership boundaries

## Deferred topics

These topics exist in the package or adjacent project patterns, but are not the primary focus of this skill version:

- grouped tables (`GroupTableComponent`, `group:load`, `group:expand`, grouped hydration)
- grouped-table editing workflows
- rich text / relation / advanced composite field editors
- advanced shape animation systems
- full event matrix beyond the stable consumer path
- deep upload-service protocol design for attachments

If the user explicitly needs those, treat them as a later enhancement path and read the package feature docs plus the host project's real implementation first.
